Humankind have spent the last 15000 years creating and atmosphere on Mars, to be able to settle there in the future.
They have not succeeded to create a habitable environment yet - as this is expected to take 2-4 billion years.

Bob Kåre 危険 注意 Junior, 483rd generation rover pilot working in his 37th year at GASA (Global Aeronautics and Space Administration),
is one of 6 million active rover pilots.
He controls the Mars rover Juniper Creek, planting atmospheric generator coils.
The coils convert Mars dust to nitrogen and oxygen.

He sits at mission control on Earth, sending command sequences to his rover.
This makes up for a challenge because of the distance between Earth and Mars. 
He can only send a limited amount of command sequences to his rover, in between power plant visits.

It is up to Bob Kåre to continue the good work creating more Mars atmosphere,
and at the same time take care of his Mars rover so that it does not break or strand without power in one of Mars' many spooky, deep craters and crevasses.
